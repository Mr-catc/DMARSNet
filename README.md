# DMARSNet: Dual-branch Network with Multi-layer Attention Refocus Structure for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation of Vegetation Remote Sensing Images
This repository is the official implementation of "DMARSNet: Dual-branch Network with Multi-layer Attention Refocus Structure for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation of Vegetation Remote Sensing Images".
### Abstract:
Vegetation semantic segmentation in remote sensing images is crucial for environmental monitoring. Deep learning-based methods have shown significant progress in this field, but they require a large number of pixel-level annotations, which can be expensive and time-consuming. Weakly supervised semantic segmentation based on image-level annotations is a more accessible and less laborious alternative. In this paper, we propose a novel weakly supervised semantic segmentation network for vegetation remote sensing images that utilizes image-level annotations. Our network comprises two branches, the Localization Branch (LB) and the Attention Relocation Branch (ARB). The LB is trained in the first stage to focus on the most discriminative regions based on image-level annotations. We introduce the ARB to make better use of the prior information contained in the labels. In the second stage, the ARB inherits the weights from the LB and incorporates a Multi-layer Attention Refocus Structure (MARS) into the network to expand the receptive field and focus on global features over a larger range. The ARB can focus on same-category regions farther apart or extend the local features attended by the LB. We integrate the class activation maps generated by the dual branches to more accurately cover the areas to be segmented. We validate the effectiveness of our approach on two remote sensing image datasets acquired by UAVs: UOPNOA(Pedrayes et al., 2021) and MiniFrance(Castillo Navarro et al., 2020). Our network achieves the best performance in terms of both quantitative metrics and qualitative results compared to other leading weakly supervised semantic segmentation networks.
